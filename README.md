# In this repository
This repo contains the files required to serve the Jekyll site we created, which are public. It also includes project documentation, which is private. Future project contributors can fork this repository to build upon the "hub" site concept as we have built it here.

# Not in this repository
The project documentation is located in another (private) repository. See https://github.com/upenndigitalscholarship/rbpdocs. Future project collaborators may request access to that repository by emailing libraryrdds@pobox.upenn.edu.
